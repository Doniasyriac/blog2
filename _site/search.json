    "text": "In early August 2024, Wayanad, Kerala, was struck by a severe landslide triggered by intense monsoon rains. This disaster has caused significant damage to several villages, with numerous homes and infrastructure severely affected. The landslide has resulted in multiple fatalities, injuries, and the displacement of many residents. Ongoing heavy rainfall has complicated rescue and relief operations, making it challenging for teams to reach affected areas and provide necessary aid. In response, local authorities, along with state and central government agencies, are working diligently to manage the crisis. Search and rescue operations are underway, and temporary shelters have been established for displaced individuals. Despite these efforts, the difficult terrain and continuous rain pose substantial hurdles to relief operations. Government and community support is crucial in addressing the immediate needs of those affected and aiding in the long-term recovery of the region."
